# Task No. A4T3

## Task Requirements
Write a program to input `year`, `month` and `date` and output the `sum_day` which means the total days in this year until the input date. (hints: leap year satisfies the condition `(year%4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year %400 == 0)`)

** Assume that the input is always valid **

## Non-Functional Requirements

Use structure type.
