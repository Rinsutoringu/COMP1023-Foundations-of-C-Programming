## Task Requirements
Write a program that reads two strings str1 and str2 from keyboards, check if str2 is a sub-string in str1. If str2 is not a sub-string in str1, append str2 at the end of str1. Assume that string length of str1 will never exceed 100 (before and after appending). You can use any string functions which are not limited to those taught in the class.

## Non-Functional Requirements
None

## I/O samples
Sample 1:
```
Enter the first string: !!! $$
Enter the second string: dd
After appending, str1 is: !!! $$dd
Press any key to continue...
```
Sample 2:
```
Enter the first string: abc abc
Enter the second string: bca
After appending, str1 is: abc abcbca
Press any key to continue...
```
Sample 3:
```
Enter the first string: abc abc
Enter the second string: bc a
No need to append, str1 is: abc abc
Press any key to continue...
```
Sample 4:
```
Enter the first string: 1234
Enter the second string: 12
No need to append, str1 is: 1234
Press any key to continue...
```
