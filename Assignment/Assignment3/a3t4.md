# Task No. A3T4

## Task Requirements
Write a program to get a positive integer `n`, and compute the number of `0’s` in n’s binary representation. Assume that the input n is always correct.

Hint: refer to the lecture slide 11 in Lecture 9

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. The program should include two functions: `main` and `int ZeroInBinary(int n)`. 
2. `ZeroInBinary` function calculate number of `0s` in binary of `n`
3. `ZeroInBinary` is a recursive function
