# Task No.A3T2

## Task Requirements

Write a program to input a simple expression with two operands and one operator, and give the output. For example, if a user inputs 10+5, the output should be 15. Assume that the operator can only be '+', '-', '*', '/', or '%'. Operands are all non-zero integers. A warning is given if operator is invalid.


## Non-Functional Requirements

The program should include two functions: a `main` function and a sub-function `int calculate(int a, char c, int b)`. Two functions are put in two .c files (one for ‘main’ function, one for ‘calculate’) and one ‘.h’ file (for the prototype of sub-function). The main function will read inputs from keyboard, check the validity of operator, call the sub-function to do the calculation, and print out the result.

**Attention:**
Compress all files together and name the compressed files as “`A3T2_ID.zip`” with ID replaced by your student ID, then upload it to AUTOLAB.
