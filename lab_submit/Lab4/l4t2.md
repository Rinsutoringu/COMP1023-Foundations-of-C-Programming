# # Task No. L4T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to calculate $a^2+b^2$. Assign the result of $a^2+b^2$ to the variable `square_sum`, then output it, where $`a`$ and $`b`$ are integers inputted from keyboard.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Define a macro for `square`, referring to lecture 4 slide 32.
2. The variable name in this program should be `a`, `b` and `square_sum`.

## I/O samples

Sample I/O:
```
