## Task Requirements
Find out the output of the following program before running it in your computer. Then run the program in computer and compare your output with the output from the computer. Change `%7d` in the second printf to `%-7d` and run again. Put the outputs as comments in the end of the program and explain the use of `%7d` and `%-7d`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main (){
    int x = 50, y = 25;
    int temp1, temp2;
    temp1 = x/++y;
    printf("temp1= %d\ty= %d\n", temp1, y);
    y=25;
    temp2 = x/y++;
    printf("temp2= %7d\ty= %d\n", temp2, y);
    return 0;
}
/* 
Output of
(1)	%7d: 
(2)	%-7d:
Explanation: 
(1)	difference between temp1 and temp2:
(2)	difference between %7d and %-7d:
