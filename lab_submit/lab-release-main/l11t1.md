# # Task No. L11T1

## Task Requirements
Write a program to calculate the circumference of the triangle. Coordinates of the triangle are input from keyboard. Assume that the inputs are valid and can always form a triangle.<br>
**Hint:** Add `#include<math.h>` at the beginning of the program so that you can use `sqrt()` function to calculate square root, e.g., `sqrt(4)` will return a value 2. The coordinates of points should be declared as float or double type.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.	Declare structures `Point`, and `Triangle` (refer to the lecture), assign coordinates to the members `p1`, `p2`, `p3` of `Point`. 
2.	Define the following macro for the computation of length of a line. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`#define LINE_LENGTH(x1,x2,y1,y2) sqrt((x1-x2)*(x1-x2) + (y1-y2)*(y1-y2))`

## I/O samples

Sample 1:
```
Enter the coordinates of the 1st point: 2, 3
Enter the coordinates of the 2nd point: 2, 6
Enter the coordinates of the 3rd point: 4, 4
the circumference of the triangle is 8.064495.
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 2:
```
Enter the coordinates of the 1st point: 3.5, 4.5
Enter the coordinates of the 2nd point: 6.5, 4.5
Enter the coordinates of the 3rd point: 7.5, 4.5
the circumference of the triangle is 8.000000.
Press any key to continue...
```
