# Task No. L10T4

## Task Requirements
Write a program to calculate the length of a string. Assume that the length of string is less than 50. 

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.	The program includes two functions: `main` and `stringLength`. 
2.	The `main` function is responsible for reading a string and calling `stringLength` to get the length of the inputted string. The `main` function will also print out the length of the string. 
3.	The prototype of `stringLength` is `int stringLength(char s[])`. The return value of this function is the length of string `s`.
4.	String function `strlen` **CANNOT** be used in the program.

## I/O samples

Sample:
```
Input a string: abcdefg
The length of the string is 7.
Press any key to continue...
