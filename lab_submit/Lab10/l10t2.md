# #$ Task No. L10T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to read a string `str` and calculate the numbers of upper-case English letters, lower-case English letters and number of spaces and output them. Then output the string with spaces removed. Assume that the length of string is less than 50.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.	Use an array to store `str`. 
2.	When you remove spaces, you should modify on the **original** `str`. `str` is the **UNIQUE** string variable to be used, and no other temporary string-type variable can be defined and used in your code.
3.	 Use `fgets` (refer to lecture slides) to read a string


## I/O samples

Sample:
```
Input a string: abCddAbc Abc kk, abce     a
Original str is abCddAbc Abc kk, abce     a
There are 3 upper-case letters, 15 lower-case letters, 8 spaces totally.
String now is abCddAbcAbckk,abcea
Press any key to continue...
```
