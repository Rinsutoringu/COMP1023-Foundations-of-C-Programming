# Task No. L7T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to find the index of an integer in an array. Assume that the array size is 50. The program will read the array elements first (end with -1, but -1 is not included) and then input an integer to search in the array. If the integer appears more than one time in the array, give the index for the first appearance of this integer. If the integer does not appear in the array, print "`Not found`".

## Non-Functional Requirements

None

## I/O samples

Sample 1
```
Please input a sequence of integers (end with -1): 1 2 3 -1
Enter the number you want to search: 2
The index of 2 in the array is 1.
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 2
```
Please input a sequence of integers (end with -1): 10 20 5 8 9 -1
Enter the number you want to search: 7
7 Not found.
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 3
```
Please input a sequence of integers (end with -1): 10 20 5 8 9 20 -1
Enter the number you want to search: 20
The index of 20 in the array is 1.
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 4
```
Please input a sequence of integers (end with -1): -1
Array is empty.
Press any key to continue...
```
