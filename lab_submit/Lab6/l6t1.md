# Task No. L6T1

## Task Requirements
Write a program to read a line of characters and output the number of the character `'c'` in this line. The line ends with `ENTER` key (i.e., `'\n'`). There is no limit to the number of characters in this line. 

## Non-Functional Requirements

Your program should read the line character by character, i.e., use `%c` in scanf statement to read repeatedly until `ENTER` key.
