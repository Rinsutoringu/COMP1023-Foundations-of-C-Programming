# # Task No. L9T4

## Task Requirements
Write a program to sum up all the natural numbers (positive integers) from 1 to `maxNum` (inclusive), where `maxNum` is input through keyboard. Output a warning if `maxNum` is smaller than 1.


## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements: The program should include a **recursive** function `sumAll` to calculate the sum.

## I/O samples

Sample 1:
```
Input maxNum: -6
Warning! Input of maxNum is invalid!
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 2:
```
Input maxNum: 7
Sum is 28.
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 3:
```
Input maxNum: 1
Sum is 1.
Press any key to continue...
```
