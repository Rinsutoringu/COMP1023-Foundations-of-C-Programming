# #$ Task No. L9T3

## Task Requirements
Write a program using two methods (recurrence and loop) to calculate **m<sup>n</sup>** where `m` is positive integer, `n` is natural number. Warning is given if the input `m` is not positive or `n` is not a natural number.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. This program contains three functions: `main` function, `PowerRec(int m, int n)`, and `PowerLoop(int m, int n)` function. 
2. The `main` reads one positive integer `m` and one natural number `n` with `scanf("%d%d", &m, &n)`, and calls the function `PowerRec` and `PowerLoop` to compute m^n and print out the results respectively. 
3. `PowerRec` must be a recursive function; `PowerLoop` use loops.
