# *#$ Task No. L14T1

## Task Requirements
Run the following program and think about the questions. Put the answers to the questions as the comments at the end of the program.
1.	What is this program supposed to do?
2.	Is the memory dynamically allocated or statically allocated
3.	What is `%*c` used for?
4.	If `%-10s` is changed to `%10s`, what happened?
5.	Why do we need to add `free(p)`?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct stuRec{
    char name[20];
    int id; 
    char gender;
};
int main()
{
    struct stuRec *p;
    p = (struct stuRec*)malloc(sizeof(struct stuRec));
    if (p) {
        printf("please input name, id and gender\n");
        scanf("%s%d%*c%c", p->name, &p->id, &p->gender);
        printf("name:%-10s,ID:%d,gender:%c\n", p->name,p->id,p->gender);
        free (p);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
