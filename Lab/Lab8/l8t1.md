# Task No. L8T1

## Task Requirements
Write a program to input a positive integer and calculate the

1. square Root (using `sqrt()`)
2. log base 10 (using `log10()`), and
3. natural log (using `log()`)

Output a warning if `n` is not a positive integer.

Hint: When function of Math library is used, Math library `math.h` should be included in the beginning.

## Non-Functional Requirements

None
