# # Task No. L8T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to calculate the ASCII difference between two characters.


## Non-Functional Requirements
Write two functions: `main` funtion and a sub-function `differenceASCIICode`. 

The `differenceASCIICode` function will count and return the difference between the ASCII code of any two characters accordingly.

For example, `differenceASCIICode('a', 'b')` returns `-1`; if `differenceASCIICode('b', 'a')` returns `1`; `differenceASCIICode('a', 'a')` returns `0`. 

The `main` function will read two characters from keyboard and call the `differenceASCIICode` function to find the difference between the inputted two characters. The `main` function will also print out result according to the return value from the `differenceASCIICode` function.

For example, if input is `a c`, then the output could be the difference between character `'a'` and `'c'` is `-2`.



## I/O samples

Sample 1
```

Sample 2
```
Please enter two characters: d a
The difference between character 'd' and 'a' is 3.
Press any key to continue...
```

Sample 3
```
Please enter two characters: m m
The difference between character 'm' and 'm' is 0.
