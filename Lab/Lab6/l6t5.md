# $ Task No. L6T5
## Task Requirements
Assume that a student has 6 courses in one semester. Write a program to input grades for all the courses and the units for each course (units can only be 1 or 3 in UIC) and then calculate sGPA (semester GPA) for this semester.
Grades and points:

A: 4, B: 3, C: 2, D: 1, F: 0.

Assumption: Consider exactly 6 courses. GPA calculation method: <img src="assets/L6T5_1.png" width = 15%>.
For example, if a student gets A, B, A, F, D, and C for six courses, the units for these six courses are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 3 respectively, then the sGPA is <img src="assets/L6T5_2.png" width = 30%>.
