# # Task No. L6T2

## Task Requirements
Write a program to input a positive integer `n`, and calculate and output 1) the sum of the even numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), storing the result in the variable `sum_even`, 2) the sum of odd numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), storing the result in the variable `sum_odd`, and 3) the difference between these two sums, i.e., `sum_even` - `sum_odd`, storing the result in the variable `diff`. Output a warning if the input `n` is not positive.

## Non-Functional Requirements

The variable names `n`, `sum_even`, `sum_odd` and `diff` must be used as required.

## I/O samples

Sample 1
```
Input an integer: 9
sum_even is 20, sum_odd is 25, diff is -5.
