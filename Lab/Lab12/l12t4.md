# Task No. L12T4

## Task Requirements
Run the program on the **slide 29 of Lecture 12** first. Then change the program so that it can calculate the sum from integer `m` to integer `n`, e.g., running the program with `sum 3 9` will calculate the sum from `3` to `9` (both inclusive). Assume that the input is always valid and `n` is not smaller than `m`.

## Non-Functional Requirements

None

## I/O samples
**Note:** before you start up Command Prompt, you should make sure of that your program has been built and “.exe” file has been generated successfully.
